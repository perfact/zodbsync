25.3.1
  * Create target folder before extracting tar files
  * Work around Debian sometimes keeping around files

25.3.0
  * Unpack or copy over additional folders besides __root__ in layer-update
  * Allow switching over to using tars for layer source without changing the
    config, expecting a __root__.tar* file inside the source instead of the
    source directly pointing towards a tar file.

25.2.0
  * Add command "zodbsync ff"
  * Print commit range

25.1.0
  * Explain publishing steps in README
  * Remove logging from signal handler
  * Provide better error message when working with empty layer
  * Re-include is_root, fixing a regression in 25.0.0

25.0.0
  * Clean up literal_eval of DeprecationWarnings.
  * Use --no-renames for path detection in layer-update
  * Write layer-source of object into Data.FS

23.4.1
  * Use lock for layer-update, avoiding interference from other operations

23.4.0
  * Refactor layering (step 1). Note that this explicitly does not try to be
    backwards compatible to a layering setup as given before. I think it will
    be much simpler to no longer support truly frozen layers where changes are
    somehow again stored into the custom layer even though the object was
    originally defined in a lower layer. Instead, every layer must have both a
    source (provided by the Debian package) and a workdir (where the contents
    of the Debian package are copied to and where subsequent changes can be
    pre-applied).

23.3.1
  * Fix path preparation for changes in __deleted__ and __frozen__ markers

23.3.0
  * Only try to playback differing paths below __root__

    layers
  * Fix layer-update for cases where the last element in both checksum files is
    not the same.

  * Panic before deleting the top-level acl_users

23.1.1
  * Add method that exposes reading the db_modtime

  * Omit title attributes if they are callable.
  * Drop support for Python 2
  * Change to using toml package configuration

22.2.4
  * Refactor scripts into entry points to be usable with zc.buildout >= 3.

22.2.3
  * Simplify recording of top-level object such that permissions that are only
    granted to Manager. This creates a one-time diff in this object, but makes
    the recording more stable in the future if permissions are added or removed

  * Add more output to reformat and allow fixing files without retrying from
    the start

22.2.2
  * Add subcommand `checkout`

  * Add github-workflow to execute tox

22.2.1
  * Change cherry-pick options for `pick` to never do rename recognition

  * Allow reformat to work with the current state only, without commits sitting
    on top of it.

    too long for the command line (#92)

  * Add test to check that unchanged objects and paths are not actually
    updated

  * Correctly playback type changes of properties

4.2.3
  * Allow recreating the top-level User Folder if it is accidentally deleted.

4.2.2
  * Handle changes between "Folder" and "Folder (Ordered)" in playback without
    needing to recursively play back everything below it, using cut+paste for
    the children instead.

  * Refactor playback to work iteratively with a stack of paths

4.2.1
  * Allow automatically resetting generic commits

4.2.0

  * Restore showing of diff that causes a failed pick

4.1.5
  * Fix timing issues in watcher

  * Add option `--replace-periods` to subcommand `upload` to replace
    periods with underscores

    certain types of files

4.1.4
  * Add subcommand `exec` to capture many git operations

  * Rewrite `pick` to use common code with `exec`, making it applicable to
    situations where `git` is able to automatically merge, but `pick` refused
    to do so before because the same file was changed.

  * Speed up tests by reusing environment

  * Increase test coverage

  * Fix `with-lock` subcommand, which used the argument named `command` twice.

4.1.3
  * Make sure Python 2 test also run under Ubuntu

  * Integrate code for creating generic commits and sending mails, adding the
    possibility to change the sender

4.1.2
  * Make with-lock work with Python 2

  * Fix perfact-zoperecord compatibility wrapper

  * Extract docstring of each subcommand for --help

  * Add py2-zope2 as test environment

4.1.1

  * Add issue template for github.

3.15.1
  * Fix lookup of parent in external editor to avoid creating a new object when
    trying to edit an existing one but using it in an acquired context.

  * Do not re-record the meta file of an object if the only change is the
    newline at the end.

3.15.0
  * Fix dry-run mode for repositories that have an upstream remote.

  * End meta files with a newline. Be aware that this will result in a change
    of the recording of existing meta files if introducing and reverting a
    change. However, since most text editors end files with a newline, this
    makes the recording more consistent in the long run.

  * Include more output if an object cannot be read during playback

  * Add --skip-errors argument for record

3.14.4
  * Include wrapper scripts for editing sources of objects by an external
    editor.

3.14.3
  * Include deprecation replacement for `perfact-zopeplayback` in installed
    scripts so the fallback from `python-perfact` will throw a readable error.

3.14.2
  * Merge separate watcher subclass into the corresponding subcommand class

  * Fix watcher so it handles changes to Users inside `User Folder`s correctly
    (#30)

  * Include a test suite and some first tests

  * Allow picking commit ranges by using COMMIT1..COMMIT2

  * Switch to using a single excutable `zodbsync` with subcommands like
    `record`, `playback`, `watch` and `pick`, opening the way to add further
    functionality.

  * Remove unused features like recording since a given timestamp or
    transaction ID. Also remove `--apply` functionality, which was not very
    helpful in the case of merge conflicts. If you really need to apply a
    patchfile, use `git am` directly, reset the branch to before the resulting
    commit and `pick` it again.

3.13.0
  Expose methods to read and write objects as well as obtain the modtime of an
  object.

3.12.5
  Sort properties alphabetically when recording, ensuring stability when
  playing back and re-recording.

  Consistently use relative paths and os.path.join, fixing #15.

  Change handling of strings in metadata for transition from Python 2 to 3.

  * Properties that were stored as bytes in Python 2 and are stored as Unicode
    in Python 3 are now recorded using UTF-8 literals instead of their 7-bit
    representation ('testü' instead of 'test\\xc3\\xbc'). This allows
    transferring the meaning of such strings from Python 2 to 3 rather than the
    implementation details, which changed for these properties.

  * Titles that were already Unicode in Python 2 are now encoded when
    recording, allowing a smaller diff in the transition to Python 3.

  * Metadata recording no longer attempts to split long lines.

  WARNING: If updating to this version, you must expect a large diff in your
  repository on the next call to zoperecord.

3.12.4
  Provide a wrapper to apply patches and play back the affected objects.

3.12.3
  Fix python3 crash in read_pdata, source might be bytes or string.

  Allow playing back of commits from a remote repository.

3.12.2
  Fix package naming error when trying to send mail with commit summary.

3.12.1
  Refactor perfact-zopeplayback so it can handle almost anything coming from
  `git diff-tree` and generally creates code that is easier to patch and deploy.

  WARNING: If updating to this version, you must expect a large diff in your
  repository on the next call to zoperecord.

  * Don't store the ID of each object in its meta data file, rely on the folder
    name only instead.

  * Don't store the contents of Folders except in Ordered Folders in order to
    store the ordering. Use the folder contents instead when uploading.

  * Adjust the ordering of ordered folders _after_ recursing into the children.

  * Allow passing newly created as well as deleted paths to perfact-zopeplayback.

3.12.0
  There is no version 3.12.0 in order to prevent anyone from thinking that
  DB-Utils 3.12 was released with zodbsync 3.12.0.

3.11.3
  Change reading and storing of permissions so it also works without acqusition
  context, which is important to get a functioning watch mode

3.11.2
  Complete separation of repositories, splitting the default config file names.

3.11.1
  PostgreSQL database dumps are no longer performed by zodbsync. This
  functionality was transferred into perfact.dbbackup. The repository for the
  code snapshots and that for the database dumps can now be separated.
