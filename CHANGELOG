4.0.3.dev0
  * Adjust remaining code to the fact that config is now a dict and not a
    module

4.0.2
  * Read Page Template source code without triggering macro expansion

  * Unregister signals before waiting for lock so we may be interrupted

  * Fix config path in README

  * Clean up Python 2 compatibility code
  
  * Add subcommand with-lock and option --no-lock

4.0.1
  * Add upload subcommand to push JS/CSS files into the Data.fs

4.0.0
  * Relax dependency to allow installation under Zope 5

  * Fix bytes/str bug with watcher under Python 3 after packing the Data.FS.

  * Add issue template for github.

3.15.1
  * Fix lookup of parent in external editor to avoid creating a new object when
    trying to edit an existing one but using it in an acquired context.

  * Do not re-record the meta file of an object if the only change is the
    newline at the end.

3.15.0
  * Fix dry-run mode for repositories that have an upstream remote.

  * End meta files with a newline. Be aware that this will result in a change
    of the recording of existing meta files if introducing and reverting a
    change. However, since most text editors end files with a newline, this
    makes the recording more consistent in the long run.

  * Include more output if an object cannot be read during playback

  * Add --skip-errors argument for record

3.14.4
  * Include wrapper scripts for editing sources of objects by an external
    editor.

3.14.3
  * Include deprecation replacement for `perfact-zopeplayback` in installed
    scripts so the fallback from `python-perfact` will throw a readable error.

3.14.2
  * Merge separate watcher subclass into the corresponding subcommand class

  * Fix watcher so it handles changes to Users inside `User Folder`s correctly
    (#30)

  * Add dry-run options to playback and pick

3.14.1
  Bugfix release: remove option accidentally added twice
  
3.14.0
  * Auto-stash unstaged changes if picking commits

  * Include a test suite and some first tests

  * Allow picking commit ranges by using COMMIT1..COMMIT2

  * Switch to using a single excutable `zodbsync` with subcommands like
    `record`, `playback`, `watch` and `pick`, opening the way to add further
    functionality.

  * Remove unused features like recording since a given timestamp or
    transaction ID. Also remove `--apply` functionality, which was not very
    helpful in the case of merge conflicts. If you really need to apply a
    patchfile, use `git am` directly, reset the branch to before the resulting
    commit and `pick` it again.

3.13.0
  Expose methods to read and write objects as well as obtain the modtime of an
  object.

3.12.5
  Sort properties alphabetically when recording, ensuring stability when
  playing back and re-recording.

  Consistently use relative paths and os.path.join, fixing #15.

  Change handling of strings in metadata for transition from Python 2 to 3.

  * Properties that were stored as bytes in Python 2 and are stored as Unicode
    in Python 3 are now recorded using UTF-8 literals instead of their 7-bit
    representation ('test√º' instead of 'test\\xc3\\xbc'). This allows
    transferring the meaning of such strings from Python 2 to 3 rather than the
    implementation details, which changed for these properties.

  * Titles that were already Unicode in Python 2 are now encoded when
    recording, allowing a smaller diff in the transition to Python 3.

  * Metadata recording no longer attempts to split long lines.

  WARNING: If updating to this version, you must expect a large diff in your
  repository on the next call to zoperecord.

3.12.4
  Provide a wrapper to apply patches and play back the affected objects.

3.12.3
  Fix python3 crash in read_pdata, source might be bytes or string.

  Allow playing back of commits from a remote repository.

3.12.2
  Fix package naming error when trying to send mail with commit summary.

3.12.1
  Refactor perfact-zopeplayback so it can handle almost anything coming from
  `git diff-tree` and generally creates code that is easier to patch and deploy.

  WARNING: If updating to this version, you must expect a large diff in your
  repository on the next call to zoperecord.

  * Don't store the ID of each object in its meta data file, rely on the folder
    name only instead.

  * Don't store the contents of Folders except in Ordered Folders in order to
    store the ordering. Use the folder contents instead when uploading.

  * Adjust the ordering of ordered folders _after_ recursing into the children.

  * Allow passing newly created as well as deleted paths to perfact-zopeplayback.

3.12.0
  There is no version 3.12.0 in order to prevent anyone from thinking that
  DB-Utils 3.12 was released with zodbsync 3.12.0.

3.11.3
  Change reading and storing of permissions so it also works without acqusition
  context, which is important to get a functioning watch mode

3.11.2
  Complete separation of repositories, splitting the default config file names.
  
3.11.1
  PostgreSQL database dumps are no longer performed by zodbsync. This
  functionality was transferred into perfact.dbbackup. The repository for the
  code snapshots and that for the database dumps can now be separated.
