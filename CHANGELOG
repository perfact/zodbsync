3.12.2
  Fix package naming error when trying to send mail with commit summary.

3.12.1
  Refactor perfact-zopeplayback so it can handle almost anything coming from
  `git diff-tree` and generally creates code that is easier to patch and deploy.

  WARNING: If updating to this version, you must expect a large diff in your
  repository on the next call to zoperecord.

  * Don't store the ID of each object in its meta data file, rely on the folder
    name only instead.

  * Don't store the contents of Folders except in Ordered Folders in order to
    store the ordering. Use the folder contents instead when uploading.

  * Adjust the ordering of ordered folders _after_ recursing into the children.

  * Allow passing newly created as well as deleted paths to perfact-zopeplayback.

3.12.0
  There is no version 3.12.0 in order to prevent anyone from thinking that
  DB-Utils 3.12 was released with zodbsync 3.12.0.

3.11.3
  Change reading and storing of permissions so it also works without acqusition
  context, which is important to get a functioning watch mode

3.11.2
  Complete separation of repositories, splitting the default config file names.
  
3.11.1
  PostgreSQL database dumps are no longer performed by zodbsync. This
  functionality was transferred into perfact.dbbackup. The repository for the
  code snapshots and that for the database dumps can now be separated.
